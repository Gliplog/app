# Testing, gates, toolchain, deployment

Part of the `engineering-standards` skill.

## Gates

| Command          | What it runs                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make check`     | lint, format check, typecheck, token check, contrast check, markdown check, knip, Vitest, build |
| `make check-all` | `make check`, Playwright e2e (phone and tablet), `npm audit --audit-level=low`                  |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the full gate on pull requests. Deployment
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs `npm run check` and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on
every push to `main`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the signed bundle and APK on a
`v*` tag (see `docs/releasing.md`). `.github/workflows/android.yml` builds a debug APK from
`npm run build:android` (Capacitor, base `/`, no service worker, `__NATIVE__` true) and fails
if the merged manifest requests a network permission. The e2e suite covers only the web build,
so native-only paths (`src/services/nativeFileTransfer.ts`) need a check on a device.

## Tests

- Domain logic: exhaustive unit tests, including unit conversion with the exact pound, WHO band
  edges, baseline selection, trial comparison at the endpoint week, and published PK parameters
  round-tripping through the solver.
- Catalog: `tests/data/catalog.spec.ts` validates the JSON against its schema, every reference,
  route and medicine matching for trials, and spot checks label endpoints.
- Storage: `fake-indexeddb` gives each test its own database; tests delete it afterwards.
- Components: mount with a real Vuetify (`tests/helpers.ts`); assert what a user or screen
  reader perceives (pressed state, aria-label), not internals. The suite must be warning-free.
- E2E: runs against the production build under the Pages base path (`/app/`), because the
  service worker only exists there. It covers logging a medication, dose and weight, BMI and
  trial comparison, compounded syringe units, unit switching, the trademark notice, an offline
  reload with stored data, manifest and service-worker scope, and the absence of third-party
  requests.
- E2E projects: `phone` (Pixel 7, Chromium), `tablet` (iPad landscape, Chromium), and `iphone`
  (iPhone 15, WebKit). `iphone` runs in CI, or locally with `GLIPLOG_E2E_WEBKIT=1` after
  `sudo npx playwright install-deps webkit`. The service-worker specs skip on WebKit because
  Playwright does not drive WebKit service workers reliably; check installs on a real iPhone.
- Inject time through `Clock`; never sleep in a test.

## Toolchain

| Tool       | Version line        | Note                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node       | 24 LTS via `.nvmrc` | `package.json` engines match; CI reads `.nvmrc`                                   |
| Vite       | 8                   | `vite-plugin-pwa` 2 (Workbox 7)                                                   |
| Vue        | 3.5                 | Router 5 (classic API, hash history), Pinia 4 (needs `@vue/devtools-api`)         |
| Vuetify    | 4                   | cascade layers; MD3 typography classes (`text-headline-large`, `text-body-small`) |
| TypeScript | 6.0                 | held below 7 until typescript-eslint supports it                                  |
| Vitest     | 5                   | happy-dom environment                                                             |

Run `npm audit --audit-level=low` before every change set: any advisory fails the gate. CI also
runs `npm audit signatures`, which verifies registry signatures and provenance and needs network
access to sigstore. Use `npm ci` in CI.

## Dependency overrides

`package.json` `overrides` patch advisories in transitive build tools that have no fixed release.
Each is build-time only; none reaches the shipped bundle. Remove an override once its parent
ships the fix, then rerun `npm audit`.

| Override                          | Why                                                                                  | Drop when                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `xcode` > `uuid` 11.1.1           | GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq; `@capacitor/cli` 8.5 pins `xcode` 3, which pulls `uuid` 7       | `@capacitor/cli` is 8.6 or later   |
| `deepmerge` to `vendor/deepmerge` | GHSA-gcqx-w48m-w2h4 has no upstream release; the vendored copy is 4.3.1 plus the fix | deepmerge releases a fixed version |

`vendor/deepmerge` is a root `devDependency` (`file:`) that the override references as
`$deepmerge`: a bare `file:` override resolves relative to the dependent package and breaks
`npm ci`. Its tests are `tests/vendor/deepmerge.spec.ts`; the service worker it helps build was
byte-identical before and after the swap.

## Build-time patches

A bug in a shipped dependency that is too small to vendor the whole package is fixed by a Vite
plugin in `build/` that rewrites the one module. It runs in the production and Android builds,
in Vitest, and in the dev pre-bundle (`optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions.plugins`). The build fails
if the expected source is missing, so an upgrade cannot ship the dependency unpatched.

| Patch                                                          | Why                                                                                                                    | Drop when                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `build/vuetify-ripple-patch.ts` (`directives/ripple/index.js`) | A touch under 80 ms leaves a ripple on screen: the deferred hide reads `currentTarget` after dispatch, when it is null | Vuetify ships the fix upstream |

Its tests are `tests/vendor/vuetify-ripple.spec.ts` and the e2e fling test in `e2e/app.spec.ts`.
